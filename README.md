GenerativeChemistry
===================

This is a well-mixed reactor model of a 'generative' chemistry on strings - that is, the reaction network is generated from stoichiometry and underlying rules (e.g. bond energies, local chemical structure). This type of chemistry effectively self-extends its own reaction network at need.
